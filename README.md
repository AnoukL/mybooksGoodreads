# mybooksGoodreads
With this code you can get the books on your read, currently-reading and to-read shelves from goodreads and export it to an sqllite database.

This is my first own project so not very streamlined or user friendly as it's mainly for personal use.
I have deleted my personal info from the loc file, so If you want to use this, you have to get an API key and secret from goodreads (https://www.goodreads.com/api) and fill this in in the "loc.py" file. 
You also have to change the 0 from id to your own goodreads id. You can get your id by going to your own account and then you see your number in the address bar.
